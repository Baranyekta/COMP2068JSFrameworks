This project is a Personal Portfolio website built using Node.js, Express, and HBS views. It consists of four main pages: Home, About Me, Projects, and Contact Me.

The first page the users are presented with is the Home page. This page serves as a comprehensive overview which welcomes visitors with a welcoming message, introduces me briefly, showcases a few of my projects with image links, and provides a little bit of information as to how viewers can contact me. This home page serves as a "one-stop, hit all" which gives users a quick brief overview of me and the website.

The About Me page dives deeper into my background, skills, education, and career goals. Offering a more in-depth breakdown of who I am!

The Projects page highlights three of my favourite projects, descriptions of them, and live links for each, allowing visitors to explore these projects as they please. 

The last page is the Contact page which includes a form for visitors to submit messages to me. This function creates a friendly connection between me and the users. Once the form has been submitted, the viewer will be redirected back to the Home page for further exploration.

Throughout all four pages, a navigation bar is located at the top which helps users travel between the different sections. The Home and About Me pages feature a footer containing image links to my social profiles, privacy policy, and copyright information. I have also added personalized animated images of myself throughout the website for a touch of uniqueness to the portfolio.
