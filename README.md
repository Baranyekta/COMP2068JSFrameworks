# COMP2068JSFrameworks AssignMate (Assignment 2B)

 AssignMate has been aimed to be a task manager application. In hopes of helping users efficiently organize their workload for a better workflow. AssignMate was aimed to have features allowing users to create, update, view, and delete tasks in order to work as a platform for managing the to-do list items.

A cool feature AssignMate (was unsuccessful with) but aims to soon achieve, is the reminder notification system. This feature (when implemented successfully), will let users set reminders for upcoming deadlines, and get notified based on those deadlines.

Regarding CSS, the approach for AssignMate was a combination of using a CSS framework like Bootstrap, and custom styling including images and a nav drawer.
